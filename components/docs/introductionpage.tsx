            Keer UI is a collection of beautifully designed, customizable
            components you can <strong>copy and paste</strong> directly into
            your projects. These components are <em>flexible</em>,{" "}
            <em>accessible</em>, and <em>open-source</em>.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is <strong className="text-foreground">NOT</strong> a
            traditional component library. Instead, it&apos;s a toolkit of
            reusable components meant to empower you to create a unique,
            scalable UI without dependency constraints.

              Unlike traditional libraries, Keer UI is not available as an
              installable npm package. You{" "}
              <strong>won&apos;t add it as a dependency</strong>; instead, you
              choose and integrate only the components you need by copying and
              pasting them into your codebase. This approach gives you{" "}
              <em>full control over customization</em>, so the components truly
              feel like part of your application.

              I firmly believe that <em>excellent design</em> plays a crucial
              role in the value of software. It&apos;s one of the primary ways
              to build <strong>trust with users</strong>, especially when
              interacting with people online. Trust is vital for online
              businesses because it&apos;s the first thing a potential customer
              assesses before deciding to make a purchase or provide their
              payment details.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong className="text-destructive">Bad design</strong>{" "}
              negatively impacts your team&apos;s reputation. It gives the
              impression of being <em>careless</em>, <em>incomplete</em>, and{" "}
              <em>unreliable</em>. It signals that the team lacks consideration
              for the user experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              Effective design suggests that the team is{" "}
              <strong>organized and capable</strong>. It builds confidence that
              they will deliver <em>quality work</em> moving forward.
