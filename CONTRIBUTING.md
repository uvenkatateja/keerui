# Contributing to KeerUI

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
Thanks for stopping by and checking out KeerUI.

This project is a personal space where I experiment with UI, animation, and motion design using React and Framer Motion.  
Think of it less as an open-source framework and more like a UI playground â€” a living lab that evolves as I learn and explore.

That said, you're more than welcome to:

- Explore the components
- Take inspiration for your own projects
- Share feedback or ideas

However, I'm currently not accepting external contributions or PRs, as the direction and code structure are tightly connected to my learning flow.

Thanks for understanding â€” and feel free to star the repo if you found anything useful! ðŸŒŸ
